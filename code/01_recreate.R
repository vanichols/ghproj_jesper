# use the data jesper uses in the paper
# make it so it will be easy to play with

# inputs:
# - replicates (start with 1)
# - 9 intensities (make so can remove some)
# - crop soil cover (use jesper starting values)
# - weed density (use jesper values)
# - Use Jesper assumptions for fitting Cousen's curve
# - Crop yields at each soil cover (use his values)

#--take all of these and calc optimum soil cover using
#  a polynomial fit or something? unclear from his paper
#  ANOVA to compare each of the intensities


#--cousens curve note
#--jesper uses a calculation that looks a little 
# different compared to what he presents
